       <p></p>
       <p>I am a Slovak student about to finish a master’s degree in marketing communications. Since high school, I have been working and gaining experience in a variety of marketing fields: copywriting, social media management, and graphic design. I am currently working as a graphic designer for a marketing agency in Bratislava, Slovakia.</p>
       <p>As a graphic designer and content creator working with websites, I sometimes worked with programming languages such as: Javascript, and PHP. And the more I work and develop programming, the more I realise just how much I enjoy it.</p>
       <p>I love creating something that is functional, valuable, new, and hat can help people. And I enjoy solving any problem that may arise. Currently, I am looking for a company that wagers on my potential and helps me further my career as a developer.</p>

        <h3>About my <span class="red_color">experiences</span>...</h3>
        <p>In high school, I attended courses like programming and web design where I studied HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and Java. Later on, during university, I studied WordPress development. I was also programming during my free time - I created some of own projects, I helped my friends, and friends of friends with their websites and I am currently supporting the development team at Teapot, marketing agency in Bratislava, Slovakia.</p>
        <p>I continue to have a deep passion for design and marketing. Aside from programming, I can help you with building frameworks, UI prototypes, visual identities, or social media strategy. All I ask is for an opportunity to show what I’m capable of.</p>

        <p>During my time in Teapot marketing agency, we had a client that sells CBD oil. When preparing materials for their website, it was necessary to note an approximate daily dose of CBD for a person. I found out the dosing of CBD is not that simple, and I could not find any decent calculator of CBD dosages in the Slovak language. So, I made one...</p>

          <p>The app is designed as mobile-first. I made the UX intuitive, without any unnecessary elements and with large and easy-reachable buttons. The UI has a feeling of calm and nature thanks to round boxes and colours. I intentionally didn’t use green as a primary colour, to make it different from similar websites that are always green.</p>
          <p>The app is made with HTML and CSS without frameworks. It uses Vanilla Javascript. In the future, I would like to add a possibility to show results after the customer will enter their e-mail and create a tool for gathering e-mail addresses from the app.</p>

   Woocomerce, PHP</p>
        <p>I was helping a friend with his e-commerce store in Woocomerce. He needed to have two products sharing the same stock, however, we couldn’t find any plugin that could handle it. That’s why I created a simple plugin for him with this function.</p>
        <a class="projects_see_more" onclick="seeProject('project_plugin');">SEE MORE ABOUT THIS PROJECT</a>
        <div class="hidden_part d-none"> 
          <p>The plugin adds a custom field in the product page of Woocomerce. Here, the admin can put an ID of the product, that he wants to pair. When a customer will buy this product, the stock of paired product will be reduced as well.</p>
          <p>Apart from this functionality, I made a basic validation that will alert the admin if he puts a non-existing product or the same product. If the product pairing is complete from both sites, the app will show a message with information of successful pairing.</p>
          <p>I think, this plugin can help also other Woocomerce websites owners. That’s why I would like to finish it, add some more functionality, and improve the UI design of the plugin. Then, I will attempt to add it to the Wordpress store.</p>

   HTML, CSS and Javascript</p>
        <p>This is an older, unfinished project I created five years ago. During my last year of high school, I was preparing for the final state exams. I was revising using exam papers from previous years. However, it took a lot of time to evaluate my score and check correct answers. As part of procrastination to avoid studying for state exams, I started to create an app that can help me with this problem.</p>

        <div class="hidden_part d-none"> 
          <p>This app was designed to show old final exam tests from the Slovak language. A student has 100 minutes to pass all questions and after that, the app will evaluate their answers and tell, whether they had passed or not.</p>
          <p>Currently, the app shows just one test from 2016. It’s not responsive, because it was designed only for mobile devices. Also, I used some techniques that are now considered dated. The project is unfinished, but one day I may return to it and finish it. I still think it could be useful for many high school students.</p>
