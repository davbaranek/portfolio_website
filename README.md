# Portfolio website

I need a job. 👨‍💻

So I created this portfolio that will present my work to the world. 🎉 

I don't have many own projects, so at least this portfolio website had to be perfect!

There is my name, my photo, some headlines, a big call-to-action at the end and a cool effect of unrolling any project to see more information. 

I designed it all by myself in Figma. 

And I built it only with Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. 🌴

Yes... I could build it much faster with some good frameworks. But I decided to code it all the old-school hard way only with my own JS scripts. 'cause I like coding. 😎

pls hire me
